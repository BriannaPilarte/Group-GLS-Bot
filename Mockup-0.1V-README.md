This is our 0.1V mock-up of Group GLS Bot. This bot says fun facts using the bot requires the admin token which can be provided if asked for it however, it would state it was a security risk so for the purpose of uploading it here it has been rplaced with "our token". 
The bot loads both rules-1 and rules-2 which has multiple key phrases to respond with. To view these phrases and responses check out rules-1.csv and rules-2.csv. 
The next version of the bot will be something like a flashcard as shown in the solution overview of the bot.
